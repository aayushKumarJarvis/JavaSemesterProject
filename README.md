True Caller Utility in JAVA
===========================

Supposed to be Terminal Version of True Caller.

It Leverages the services of TrueCaller. Can be said as a JAVA Client for it. 

How it works
============

The backend class for the preparing the request based on your phone number has been implemented. 

Now it's upto the client programmer, as to how he wants to use this backend class for his application. However, 
I have added the main function to let you test the methods defined. 

Let me know if you find any discrepancies. 

Contributions
=============

This is a very basic implementation that I have though of. To be honest, just an hour's work ;)

In case you have better ideas on it, then please do send me a pull request on the same.
